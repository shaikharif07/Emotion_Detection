# Project Directory

This directory contains the Colab notebook for the entire workflow, including:

1. **Data Analysis and Understanding:**
    - Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's distribution and characteristics.
    - Visualize class distributions and sample images to identify class imbalances and data quality.

2. **Custom CNN:**
    - Design and iterate on custom CNN architectures to optimize model performance.
    - Experiment with different layer configurations, activation functions, and kernel initializations.

3. **Callbacks:**
    - Implement callbacks such as `ModelCheckpoint`, `EarlyStopping`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, and `CSVLogger` to enhance training efficiency and model performance.

4. **Class Weights:**
    - Address class imbalance by assigning class weights during model training to give more importance to underrepresented classes.

5. **Image Augmentation:**
    - Employ image augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip to artificially increase the diversity of the training dataset.

6. **Transfer Learning Model Training:**
    - Utilize pre-trained models for transfer learning to leverage learned features and improve model accuracy, specifically:
        - **VGG16**
        - **ResNet50**

7. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate model performance using various metrics and tools:
        - ROC curves
        - Classification reports
        - Confusion matrices

8. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the model using Gradio for real-time emotion detection in live video streams.
